<h1>Sample SpringBoot + CRNK Maven project</h1>
<code>localhost:8080/trainers</code>
<p>Mark: latest SpringBoot verison (2.5.5) has no implementation for Crnk error controller (or something like that). That gives us exeption when we are trying to visit undefinded pages like "/" or  "/qwerty". At version 2.4.2 everything is fine.</p>
